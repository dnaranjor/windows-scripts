# Windows Server scripts and hacks that let us all rest at night

This is just an open, Internet-centric repository of all the Windows Server scripts and hacks I've been both developing and finding through the years as a both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server's DBA.

Parallel projects will be Oracle RDBMS Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase ASE scripts.

Collaborations allowed, of course.
